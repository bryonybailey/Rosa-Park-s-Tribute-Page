She grew up on a farm with her maternal grandparents, mother, and younger brother Sylvester. They all were members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), a century-old independent

    recieving her High School diploma which at the time is a notable accomplishment as very few Black people in
    Alabama held this degree.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong><u>1943</u></strong>
    <br>
    Rosa joins the Montgomery branch of the NAACP, as the only woman at her first meetinig, she is named secretary
    of the group. Her work included investigating crimes against Black people such as murder, assaults and police
    brutality.
    Rosa also attempted to register to vote but was told that she had failed the literacy test that was required of
    Black voters.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong><u>1944</u></strong>
    <br>
    Rosa helps establish the Committee for Equal Justice for the Rights of Mrs.Recy Taylor (A Black woman from who

    <br>
    <br>
    <strong><u>1948</u></strong>
    <br>

    Rosa attended a two-week training session at Highlander Folk School in Tenessee. Alongside other civil rights
    activists, both Black and White, she discussed how to integrate schools following the Supreme Court's Brown v.
    Board of Education decision of 1954.
    <br>
    <br>
    After working all day, Rosa boarded the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus around 6.p.m, Thursday, in downtown Montgomery. She paid her fare and sat in an empty seat in the first row of back seats reserved for Blacks in the "colored" section. Near the middle of the bus, her row was directly behind the ten seats reserved for White passengers.
    <br>
    <br>

    Initially, she did not notice that the bus driver was the same man, James F. Blake, who had left her in the rain in 1943. As the bus traveled along its regular route, all of the White-only seats in the bus filled up. The bus reached the third stop in front of the Empire Theater, and several White passengers boarded. Blake noted that two or three White passengers were standing, as the front of the bus had filled to capacity.
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="rosa-quote">
        <strong>
            "When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered us up and out of our seats. I felt a determination cover my body like a quilt on a winter night."
        </strong>
    </div>
    <br>

    The bus driver moved the "colored" section sign behind Parks and demanded that four Black people give up their seats in the middle section so that the White passengers could sit. Parks moved, but toward the window seat; she did not get up to move to the redesignated colored section.
    <br>
    <br>
    On December 5th The news of Rosa's case spurs the Black Community to begin a boycott of the Montgomery bus
    system, in which Rosa participated in and was again arrested along with other boycott organizers for violating
    anti-boycott laws. In January 1956 Rosa lost her job as an assistant tailor at the Montgomery Fair department store.

    <br>
    <div class="rosa-quote">
        <strong>
            "I did not want to be mistreated, I did not want to be deprived of a seat that I had paid for. It was just time. There was opportunity for me to take a stand to express the way I felt about being treated in that manner."

    Rosa was unable to find work in Montgomery and was still facing threats for her role in the bus boycott. Rosa and Raymond moved to Detroit due to her not being able to find work and also participated in the Prayer Pilgramage for Freedom. 
    <br>
    Later that year, at the urging of her brother and sister-in-law in Detroit, Sylvester and Daisy McCauley, Rosa and Raymond Parks and her mother moved north to join them. The City of Detroit attempted to cultivate a progressive reputation, but Parks encountered numerous signs of discrimination against African-Americans. Schools were effectively segregated, and services in Black neighborhoods substandard.

Parks also served on the Board of Advocates of Planned Parenthood.
    <br>
    <br>
    Though her health declined as she entered her seventies, Parks continued to make many appearances and devoted considerable energy to these causes. Unrelated to her activism, Parks loaned quilts of her own making to an exhibit at Michigan State University of quilts by African-American residents of Michigan.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong><u>1992</u></strong>

    <br>
    <strong><u>1994</u></strong>

    At age 81, Parks was robbed and assaulted in her home in central Detroit on August 30th. The assailant, Joseph Skipper, broke down the door but claimed he had chased away an intruder. He requested a reward and when Parks paid him, he demanded more. Parks refused and he attacked her. Hurt and badly shaken, Parks called a friend, who called the police. A neighborhood manhunt led to Skipper's capture and reported beating. Parks was treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital for facial injuries and swelling on the right side of her face.

    <br>
    Parks received an eviction notice from her $1,800 per month (equivalent to $2,700 in 2021) apartment for non-payment of rent. Parks was incapable of managing her own financial affairs by this time due to age-related physical and mental decline. Her rent was paid from a collection taken by Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit. When her rent became delinquent and her impending eviction was highly publicized in 2004, executives of the ownership company announced they had forgiven the back rent and would allow Parks, by then 91 and in extremely poor health, to live rent-free in the building for the remainder of her life.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong><u>2005</u></strong>
    <br>

    She and her husband never had children and she outlived her only sibling. She was survived by her sister-in-law (Raymond's sister), 13 nieces and nephews and their families, and several cousins, most of them residents of Michigan or Alabama.
    <br>
    <br>
    City officials in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27, 2005, that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons in honor of Parks until her funeral. Parks' coffin was flown to Montgomery and taken in a horse-drawn hearse to the St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, where she lay in repose at the altar on October 29, 2005, dressed in the uniform of a church deaconess.

    Like many Detroit Blacks, Parks remained particularly concerned about housing issues. She herself lived in a neighborhood, Virginia Park, which had been compromised by highway construction and urban renewal. By 1962, these policies had destroyed 10,000 structures in Detroit, displacing 43,096 people, 70 percent of them African-American.
